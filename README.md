# Touhou-Danmakufu-ph3sx-2

A modified version of Touhou Danmakufu ph3 geared towards optimization and availability of more complex features.
DnhViewer is not provided nor supported.

Not guaranteed to not randomly crash.
Do not assume complete backwards compatibility with vanilla ph3. Contact me for a definitive answer.

Mainly intended for use in the upcoming Touhou fangames Sapphire Panlogism and Treasure Castle Labyrinth. A re-upload because GitHub was an incomprehensible piece of *\[EXCESS EXPLETIVE GRACEFULLY REDACTED\]*.

Special Thanks:
- **WishMakers** - Mainly for providing a non-broken reference point with his th_dnh_woo repository. Slightly-less-mainly for that one pull request I never acted upon.
- **Naudiz** - For subjecting me to a myriad of unspeakable acts of torture with his near-hourly bug reports and feature requests, and an emotional support dog/wolf/spyrogyra/whateverthefuckhisspeciesis.
