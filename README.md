# Touhou-Danmakufu-ph3sx-2
A modification of Touhou Danmakufu ph3 intended for use in the upcoming Touhou fangames Sapphire Panlogism and Treasure Castle Labyrinth. A re-upload because GitHub was fucking retarded.

Special Thanks:
**WishMakers** - Mainly for providing a non-broken reference point with his th_dnh_woo repository. Slightly-less-mainly for that one pull request I never acted upon.
**Naudiz** - For subjecting me to a myriad of unspeakable acts of torture with his near-hourly bug reports and feature requests, and an emotional support dog/wolf/spyrogyra/whateverthefuckhisspeciesis.
