- New Keywords
	- switch
		Equivalent to "alternative".
	- default
		Equivalent to "others".
	- continue
		Usage similar to "break", but only skips the current iteration of the loop.
	- for
		Used to declare a for loop.
	- each
		Used in conjunction with "for" to create a for each loop.
	- const
		Used to declare a constant.
			
- New Features
	- Constant Variables
		Variables whose values cannot be changed.
		Any attempt to do so will throw a compile-time error.
		
		Examples:
			const a = 50;
			let b = a + 80;			//OK
			ascent (i in 0..a) {}	//OK
			a = 100;				//ERROR
			a *= 4;					//ERROR
			
			for (const a = 0; a < 10; a++) {}	//ERROR
			for (const a = 0; a < 10; b++) {}	//OK
			
	- Function Overloading
		Functions and tasks can be re-declared with different amount of parameters.
		
		Example:
			function DoStuff() {
				return 0;
			}
			function DoStuff(arg0) {
				return 100;
			}
			function DoStuff(arg0, arg1, arg2, arg3) {
				return arg0 + arg1 + arg2 + arg3;
			}
			
			DoStuff();				//Returns 0
			DoStuff("foo");			//Returns 100
			DoStuff(1, 2, 3, 4)		//Returns 10
			
	- Loop Continues
		Skips the current iteration of the loop it was used in.
		
		Example:
			ascent (i in 0..10) {
				if (i % 2 == 1) { continue; }
				WriteLog(i)
			}
			//Output: 0 2 4 6 8
			
	- For Loops
		Read "Statements and Flow Controls" or something similar on a decent C/C++ tutorial.
		
		Examples:
			for (let a = 0; a < 6; a++) {}
			
			let b = 0;
			for (b = 6; b >= -10; b--) {}
			
			for (let c = []; length(c) < 10; c = c ~ [rand(-10, 10)]) {}
			
	- For Each Loops
		Iterates through an array.
		Note: You can use either "in" or a colon, it doesn't matter.
		
		Examples:
			let sum = 0;
			for each (iDigit in [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) {
				sum += iDigit;
			}

			let objArray = [obj1, obj2, obj3, obj4];
			for each (let iObj : objArray) {
				Obj_Delete(iObj);
			}

			for each (iChar in "ph3sx") {
				WriteLog(iChar);
			}

			let numArray = [0, 1, 2, 3];
			for each (iNum in numArray) {
				numArray = numArray ~ [rand(0, 10)];
				WriteLog(iNum);
			}
			//The code above will produce 0, 1, 2, and finally 3, regardless of modifications to numArray during looping.
			
	- Local Blocks
		What had been:
			local {
				//code....
			}
		Can now be reduced to simply:
			{
				//code....
			}
			
		In short: "local" can be omitted.
		
	- Ternary Statements
		Read "Statements and Flow Controls" or something similar on a decent C/C++ tutorial.
	
		let variable = expression1 ? expression2 : expression3;
		
		**The ternary operator has the lowest operator precedence.

- Optimizations
	- The engine will now try to perform basic optimizations on maths expressions.
		Examples:
			a = 5 + 5 - 1;			->	a = 9;
			a = 5 * 7 / 7			->	a = 5;
			a = func(b) + 5 % 10	->	a = func(b) + 5;

	- Loops and blocks without code will now be optimized away during script compiling.
		Examples:
			while (true) {}
			
			for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {}
			
			ascent (i in 0..100000000000) {}

			{
			}
			
			loop (1000) {
			}

			for each (i in "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa") {}
			
	- Loops containing a single yield will be automatically transformed into a wait.
		Examples:
			loop (60) { yield; }		//-> wait(60);
			
			let a = 100;
			loop (a * 2 + 60 - 20) {	//-> wait(a * 2 + 60 - 20);
				yield;
			}

- Behaviour Changes
	- "break;" will no longer cause catastrophes when used outside loops, as its scope of operation no longer extends beyond a task/function.
	- Backslash escapes (\\) can now be used in char/string values.
	- A hexadecimal char literal (\x[hex]) can now be used in char/string values.
		Example:
			"\x74"			-> "t"
			'\x3042'		-> 'あ'
			"\x042\x5f"		-> "B_"
	- One-lined statements.
		Example:
			ascent (i in 0..10) WriteLog(i);
			
			if (true) a += 10;
			else a -= 4;
			
		Can be used everywhere except function/task/sub declarations, @ blocks, and local{} blocks.
